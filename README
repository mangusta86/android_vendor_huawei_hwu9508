This are the vendor files for compiling CM-10.1 with nearly all hw libraries from Huawei (just liblight coded)

In order to recreate updated proprietary files we have 2 ways:
1) from mobile phone connected via adb (you need to have android-sdk platform-tools in your PATH)
2) extract files from EmotionUI ROM (remember to set the right folder inside the script. ex: EUIFOLDER=/path_to_your_ROM_system_folder).
